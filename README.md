# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description
This application was developed to show a 5-day forecast of the weather for any area entered into the search bar. This uses a server-side API that can dynamically update itself and runs in the browser.

## Installation
This can be accessed through the GitHub pages. When entered and brought to a new browser window you are presented with a search bar 
with the header "Search for a City", and in the search bar, you have an example of New York. When a city name has been entered it will bring up a 5-day forecast of said city. Also, each city will be logged under the search bar so easy access if wanted to be looked at again.

## Usage
This application can be helpful if you are wanting to see what upcoming and present weather conditions are. It also keeps track of what is being searched for easy access once returned if the desired city is searched again.
